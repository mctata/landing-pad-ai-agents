# Landing Pad Digital AI Agents Collaboration Model

This document outlines the collaboration framework that enables the five AI agents to work together efficiently, share information, and produce cohesive content outputs.

## Collaboration Architecture

### Central Components

1. **Message Bus**
   - Real-time communication channel between agents
   - Standardized message format for inter-agent requests
   - Publish-subscribe system with dedicated topic channels
   - Priority messaging for urgent collaboration needs

2. **Shared Knowledge Repository**
   - Centralized database for content, assets, and performance data
   - Version control for all content artifacts
   - Accessible to all agents with appropriate read/write permissions
   - Structured metadata for efficient cross-referencing

3. **Workflow Orchestrator**
   - Manages end-to-end content workflows
   - Tracks dependencies between agent tasks
   - Handles state management for all content items
   - Provides synchronization mechanisms for collaborative work

4. **Common Data Models**
   - Standardized content schema used by all agents
   - Unified taxonomy and categorization system
   - Consistent metrics definitions for performance assessment
   - Shared audience persona framework

## Information Flow

### Content Creation Workflow

1. **Content Strategy Initiation**
   - Content Strategy Agent generates content brief based on analysis
   - Brief published to Knowledge Repository
   - Notification sent to Content Creation Agent via Message Bus

2. **Content Development**
   - Content Creation Agent retrieves brief from Knowledge Repository
   - Creates draft content and publishes to Knowledge Repository
   - Notification sent to Brand Consistency Agent for review

3. **Brand Review**
   - Brand Consistency Agent analyzes content against guidelines
   - Provides feedback via Message Bus to Content Creation Agent
   - Updates content status in Workflow Orchestrator

4. **Content Refinement**
   - Content Creation Agent makes revisions based on feedback
   - Updates content in Knowledge Repository
   - Notification sent to Content Management Agent

5. **Publishing Preparation**
   - Content Management Agent formats content for target platform
   - Schedules publication via Workflow Orchestrator
   - Notifies all agents of upcoming publication

6. **Post-Publication Analysis**
   - Optimisation Agent collects performance metrics
   - Updates Knowledge Repository with results
   - Sends insights to Content Strategy Agent for future planning

### Cross-Functional Collaboration

#### Daily Synchronization

The agents participate in a daily synchronization process:

1. Each agent publishes status updates to the Message Bus
2. Workflow Orchestrator identifies bottlenecks or issues
3. Automated adjustments to priorities and schedules are made
4. New collaboration tasks are assigned as needed

#### Exception Handling

When unexpected issues arise:

1. Agent identifies problem and publishes alert to Message Bus
2. Relevant agents subscribe to problem resolution topic
3. Collaborative solution developed through shared Knowledge Repository
4. Workflow Orchestrator updates process to incorporate solution

## Collaboration Interfaces

### Standard Message Format

```json
{
  "messageId": "msg-2025-03-11-0042",
  "timestamp": "2025-03-11T14:32:17Z",
  "senderAgent": "ContentStrategyAgent",
  "recipientAgents": ["ContentCreationAgent"],
  "messageType": "ContentBriefAssignment",
  "priority": "Normal",
  "payload": {
    "contentId": "BP-2025-034",
    "briefLocation": "/briefs/BP-2025-034.json",
    "dueDate": "2025-03-15T17:00:00Z",
    "additionalNotes": "Focus on AI personalization features"
  },
  "requiredResponse": true,
  "responseDeadline": "2025-03-11T16:00:00Z"
}
```

### Knowledge Repository Structure

```
/briefs/             # Content strategy briefs
  /active/           # Currently in production
  /completed/        # Historical briefs
  /templates/        # Reusable brief templates

/content/            # Content artifacts
  /drafts/           # Work in progress
  /review/           # Awaiting brand review
  /approved/         # Ready for publishing
  /published/        # Live content archive
  /assets/           # Shared media assets

/performance/        # Analytics and metrics
  /campaigns/        # Campaign-level data
  /content/          # Individual content performance
  /audience/         # Audience behavior data
  /experiments/      # A/B testing results

/brand/              # Brand guidelines and assets
  /guidelines/       # Official brand documentation
  /terminology/      # Approved terms database
  /templates/        # Brand-approved templates
  /assets/           # Logo, colors, fonts, etc.
```

## Decision Making Framework

### Collaborative Decisions

When multiple agents need to participate in decisions:

1. Issue is framed as explicit decision request in Message Bus
2. Each agent contributes perspective based on domain expertise
3. Weighted scoring system applies appropriate agent influence
4. Decision recorded in Knowledge Repository for future reference

### Decision Authority Matrix

| Decision Type | Primary Authority | Secondary Input | Notification Only |
|---------------|------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Content Topics | Content Strategy | Optimisation | Creation, Management, Brand |
| Content Format | Content Strategy | Creation, Brand | Management, Optimisation |
| Writing Style | Brand Consistency | Creation | Strategy, Management, Optimisation |
| Publishing Schedule | Content Management | Strategy | Creation, Brand, Optimisation |
| SEO Tactics | Optimisation | Creation, Strategy | Management, Brand |
| Performance Goals | Strategy | Optimisation | Creation, Management, Brand |
| Brand Guidelines | Brand Consistency | Strategy | Creation, Management, Optimisation |

## Collaboration Metrics

### Efficiency Metrics

- Average time from brief to publication
- Number of revision cycles per content piece
- Response time to inter-agent requests
- Resource utilization across agent team

### Quality Metrics

- Content coherence across channels
- Brand consistency score
- Strategic alignment rating
- Performance against defined KPIs

## Continuous Improvement

1. Weekly collaboration effectiveness review
2. Identification of friction points in workflows
3. Pattern analysis of successful collaboration instances
4. Process refinement based on performance data
5. Documentation of best practices in Knowledge Repository

1. Optimisation Agent detects performance drop
2. Analyzes potential causes and shares with Strategy Agent
3. Strategy Agent determines update approach
4. Content Creation Agent receives refresh brief
5. Brand Consistency Agent reviews for current guidelines
6. Management Agent handles republishing
