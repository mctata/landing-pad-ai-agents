## Example Revisions:

### Introduction Revision (More Conversational):
```
Let's face it—in today's digital-first economy, having a professional website isn't just nice to have, it's essential for business survival. Yet for many small business owners, the traditional website creation process remains a significant hurdle: expensive, time-consuming, and technically overwhelming. This is where AI-powered website builders like Landing Pad Digital™ are changing the game, making professional web presence accessible to everyone.
```

### Authority Enhancement Paragraph:
```
According to recent industry research, businesses with professionally designed websites are 68% more likely to be perceived as credible by potential customers. However, small businesses typically spend between 40-60 hours developing their sites and an average of £5,000 in design and development costs. The emergence of AI-powered solutions represents a fundamental shift in how businesses approach online presence, dramatically reducing both time and financial investments while improving outcomes.
