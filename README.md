# Landing Pad Digital AI Content Agents

A comprehensive framework for automating and enhancing Landing Pad Digital's daily content operations using a team of specialized AI agents.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation details, collaboration models, and example outputs for Landing Pad Digital's AI agent content team. Each agent is designed to perform specific tasks while collaborating seamlessly to achieve the overarching goal of:

1. Educating users about Landing Pad Digital's AI-powered website builder
2. Establishing the brand as a professional authority in the website creation space
3. Streamlining content operations for maximum efficiency and impact

## Agent Team Structure

Our AI content team consists of five specialized agents:

1. **Content Strategy Agent**: Analyses audience data and trends to inform content decisions
2. **Content Creation Agent**: Generates high-quality blog posts, website copy, and social media content
3. **Content Management Agent**: Organises, categorises, and tracks content across platforms
4. **Optimisation Agent**: Analyses performance metrics and provides SEO recommendations
5. **Brand Consistency Agent**: Maintains Landing Pad Digital's voice, tone, and messaging

## Implementation

Each agent is implemented as a separate module with clear inputs, processes, and outputs. The agents communicate via a shared message bus and centralised data store to ensure seamless collaboration.

## Collaboration Model
