# Landing Pad Digital AI Agents - Implementation Guide

This guide documents the implementation of the Landing Pad Digital AI Content Agents system based on the specifications in the prompt-agents.rtf document.

## Overview

The Landing Pad Digital AI Agents system consists of five specialized agents that collaborate to create and manage content that educates users about Landing Pad Digital's AI-powered website builder while establishing the brand as a professional authority in the website creation space.

## Agent Architecture

Each agent follows a modular architecture with the following components:

1. **Agent Core**: Extends BaseAgent class, handles command processing and event publishing
2. **Modules**: Specialized components that implement specific functionality
3. **Services**: Shared utilities for messaging, storage, and AI integration

### Base Agent

All agents extend the BaseAgent class, which provides:

- Error handling
- Lifecycle management
- Utility functions

3. Content Creation Agent creates content based on the brief and publishes a "content_created" event
4. Content Management Agent and Optimisation Agent process the content in their respective ways
